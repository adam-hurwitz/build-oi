# Process

1. Application is complete
2. Differentiation
    a. Compare to similar products in the short and long-term
    b. Specific technical considerations related to the opportunity
3. Implementation
    a. Outline each feature that will be built
    b. Link to the tools that will be used, e.g. APIs, SDKs, libraries, etc.
    c. Include the specific documentation from the tools (If available) for feature.
    d. Timeline of how much time is planned for each step of the development process for each feature, i.e. What will be worked on each week, 2 weeks, or however you decide to segment your time?
4. Team
    a. Team's background, past work, and projects
    b. Provide links to publicly accessible sources. If not available, provide references of who to talk to about previous work together.
6. Wait until the final submission to provide scores
