Opportunities
===

## Security

- [ Native sign-in with multi-factor authentication (MFA) #319 ](https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd-io-issues/issues/319) (P0)
    - Currently MFA is through third-parties, e.g. Twitter, GitHub, and etc.
- Backup notes based on folder architecture (P1)
    - Organize notes into folders in the app. 
    - *Settings* > *Download all notes* downloads the notes into local directories that match the app folder architecture.
    - This will make backing up a large amount of notes  user-friendly.

## Editor

### Web app

- More shortcut/hotkey commands to handle Markdown generation (P1)
- What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor for Markdown (P1)
    - Great for beginner users to get started writing
- Spelling and grammar check
    - [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) compatibility (Open-source) (P1)
    - Add new words to the spell checker dictionary (P1)
- Word and character counters (P2)
    - Show the counts for highlighted text.
- Table builder UI in the toolbar (P2)

    - Add lists within a cell
        - Based on HTML elements

## Version control systems (VCS)

- GitLab integration for individual use (P1)
- [Radicle.xyz](https://radicle.xyz) integration â€“ [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1h1C7IlcHJeRDy72E2ycb7br3lumpU631rN9CMpm8E/edit#heading=h.rprz9yqw2qqg) (P2)
- Allow shared users of a note that have *Admin* and *Write* access to Push/Pull a note with GitHub. (P2)
    - The Push and Pull options do not show in a shared user's Note.
    - Note overflow menu (3 dots in the top-right) > *Versions and GitHub Sync* > *Pull from GitHub* or *Push to GitHub*
    - Workaround: Create a public team: [Create and manage Team](https://hackmd.io/@docs/create-and-manage-team)
    - Workaround: Shared users can maintain a separate note to push/pull with GitHub.
