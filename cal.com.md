# Opportunities

*Prioritization key*

- P0: Critical blocker in moving forward and time sensitive
- P1: Important and will have a large impact to improve efficiency and/or effectiveness
- P2: Important and not as time sensitive
- P3: Nice to have


#### Automatically invite an email account to events (P1)

- This is useful when multiple people are regularly on a call
- This is a good workaround to show an event on multiple calendars, e.g. Someone who's migrating to Skiff and needs to still have events show on their Google calendar
